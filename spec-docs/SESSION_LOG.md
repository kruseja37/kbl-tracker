## Session: 2026-02-12 — Full Stack Audit + Post-Season Build
### Accomplished
- Full Stack Audit: 28 defects found and fixed (2 CRITICAL, 12 MAJOR, 8 MINOR, 4 INFO)
- DEF-001 CRITICAL: Fixed IndexedDB v2/v3 version deadlock (created trackerDb.ts)
- DEF-002 CRITICAL: Deleted stadiumData.ts, wired real stadium names from IndexedDB
- All Math.random() fake stats removed
- All hardcoded MLB names removed from franchise UI
- MOCK_* constants renamed to EMPTY_*
- Orphan variables cleaned up
### Post-Season Build (4 Batches)
- Batch 1: Wired 5 orphaned code assets (seasonTransitionEngine, qualifyTeams, SeasonEndFlow, PlayoffSeedingFlow, PostseasonMVPFlow)
- Batch 2: Added playoff SIM, cleaned WorldSeries LEADERS/HISTORY tabs
- Batch 3: Offseason persistence (retirements, FA, draft, ratings all modify actual rosters)
- Batch 4: Both season advancement paths aligned, career stats verified safe
### Bug Fixes
- 3 React hooks crashes fixed (SpecialAwardsScreen, RetirementFlow, FinalizeAdvanceFlow)
- 3 missing offseason tabs added (Farm Reconciliation, Chemistry Rebalancing, Spring Training)
- Tab order corrected to match state machine
- Contraction/Expansion: 1,310 lines of stub replaced with 64-line honest placeholder
### Full Lifecycle Verified
- Season 1 → Playoffs → Champion → Offseason (11/11 phases) → Season 2 → Play games ✅
- 0 console errors throughout
### Browser-Verified Flows (continued session)
- League Leaders N/A fix: rewired batch SIM to full pipeline (generateSyntheticGame + processCompletedGame)
- useFranchiseData: dynamic seasonId from currentSeason param (was hardcoded season-1)
- FreeAgencyFlow hooks crash: moved isLoading early return after all hooks + guarded currentTeam access
- DraftFlow: replaced 2 hardcoded "SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS" with dynamic userTeamName
- Flow D1 (Free Agency): PASS — full protection→dice→destination→exchange flow with real players
- Flow D2 (Draft): PASS — 20 AI-generated prospects, user pick, roster tracking (FIXED MLB name bug)
- Flow D3 (GameTracker Season 2): PASS — game loads with full field, all buttons, playable
- Flow D4 (Museum): PASS — UI loads (6 tabs), data empty (expected: museum pipeline not built yet)
### Offseason Phase Machine Verification (continued session)
- Wired SpringTrainingFlow `onComplete` prop from FranchiseHome → handleAdvancePhase
- SIMmed Season 2: 160 regular season games → playoffs (Crocodons champion, 4-0 sweep of Wideloads) → offseason
- Systematically verified ALL 11 offseason phase transitions via browser:
  - Phase 1→2 (STANDINGS_FINAL → AWARDS): PASS — tab auto-selected to AWARDS, Awards Ceremony content loaded
  - Phase 2→3 (AWARDS → RATINGS_ADJUSTMENTS): PASS — tab auto-selected to RATINGS ADJ
  - Phase 3→4 (RATINGS_ADJUSTMENTS → CONTRACTION_EXPANSION): PASS — tab auto-selected to CONTRACT/EXPAND
  - Phase 4→5 (CONTRACTION_EXPANSION → RETIREMENTS): PASS — tab auto-selected to RETIREMENTS
  - Phase 5→6 (RETIREMENTS → FREE_AGENCY): PASS — tab auto-selected to FREE AGENCY
  - Phase 6→7 (FREE_AGENCY → DRAFT): PASS — tab auto-selected to DRAFT
  - Phase 7→8 (DRAFT → FARM_RECONCILIATION): PASS — tab auto-selected to FARM SYSTEM
  - Phase 8→9 (FARM_RECONCILIATION → CHEMISTRY_REBALANCING): PASS — tab auto-selected to CHEMISTRY
  - Phase 9→10 (CHEMISTRY_REBALANCING → TRADES): PASS — tab auto-selected to TRADES
  - Phase 10→11 (TRADES → SPRING_TRAINING): PASS — tab auto-selected to SPRING TRAINING
  - Phase 11→COMPLETED: PASS — "START SEASON 3" button appears, IndexedDB status=COMPLETED
- IndexedDB verified: all 11 phases in phasesCompleted array, completedAt timestamp present
- Spring Training content loads with real data: 78 DEVELOPING, 308 PRIME, 120 DECLINING, 0 MUST RETIRE
- Only console error: pre-existing FreeAgencyFlow hooks ordering warning (non-blocking)
### Pending (for next session)
- FinalizeAdvanceFlow requires 32 players per team (farm validation blocks advance without full draft)
- GameTracker in franchise mode shows "TIGERS/SOX" defaults instead of real team names
- Museum data pipeline needs building (all tabs empty)
- FreeAgencyFlow hooks ordering warning (React dev mode, non-blocking)
- See CURRENT_STATE.md "Known Issues" section for complete list
