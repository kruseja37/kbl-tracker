# AUTONOMOUS RUN LOG

**Run started:** 2026-06-16. Captain (Opus 4.8) driving the autonomous build→audit→commit loop per
`AUTONOMOUS_RUN_PROTOCOL.md`. JK away; reads this top-to-bottom on return.

> **Format:** newest entries at the BOTTOM of the "Ticket log" section. Each ticket: STATUS (COMMITTED /
> BUILT-NOT-COMMITTED / SET-ASIDE / HALTED), what changed, the audit verdict, and any open decision for JK.

## SESSION SUMMARY (TL;DR on return)

**Committed (3 tickets, all VERIFIED via the Codex-build / Opus-audit triangle; on `codex/franchise-v1-next`,
nothing pushed):**
- `d48ab3c` **L1** — hidden-modifier rename (loyalty/ambition/resilience/charisma) + typed on `Player`.
- `752882f` **D1** — `useSeasonStats` 162 hardcode → canonical `MLB_BASELINE_GAMES` (zero behavior change).
- `2fab709` **D2** — backup parity: 3 franchise stores registered + pin 12→15 + a structural parity-guard +
  round-trip test (the silent-drop data-integrity defect is closed).

**The honest finding:** beyond those three, the Tier-0 foundations are **design/value/product-laden**, not
mechanical — so per your AUTH-2 guardrails I built the safe set and **surfaced the rest rather than gambling
unwatched** on the value/SMB4/UX spine. Over-halting was the safe direction. **Four decisions now gate further
progress** (below). Rule them and the loop resumes fast — most are small builds once decided.

**What's set aside (and why):**
- **L1.5** (Captain) — blocked on **OD-1** (MLB players carry no hidden modifiers).
- **L-ECON1** (salary scale) — **OD-2** (value-design + must sequence with unbuilt D4/D6).
- **L2** (mutable layer), **L4a** (reporter/bus), **L9a** (trait capture) — genuine product/UX decisions
  (**OD-3/4/5**); maps are in workflow `wf_7b56fa48-a58`, decisions below.
- **D4** (salary-live UI de-gate) — recommended as the **first build of a WATCHED session** (user-visible UI
  surgery you can browser-verify immediately); D5 is confirm-only; D6+ are the value gate (surface).

## OPEN DECISIONS FOR JK (read these first)

- **OD-1 (HIGH — blocks L1.5 + the morale/development layer for MLB players) — How do imported MLB players
  acquire the 4 hidden modifiers?** Verified in code: `hiddenPersonalityModifiers` (loyalty/ambition/resilience/
  charisma) is assigned ONLY in `prospectScoutingDraftEngine.ts` (the prospect/farm path). The **22-man MLB pool
  players** (imported from `playerDatabase` via `leagueConstruction`) carry it as **`undefined`**. Consequences:
  L1.5 Captain selection (searches MLB players for highest Loyalty+Charisma) finds nothing → null captains; and
  L3 morale / L5 dampener / L8 ratings / L9b traits have no modifier data for MLB players. **This is a foundational
  gap, not just an L1.5 detail.** Options: **(a)** deterministically generate the 4 modifiers for every player at
  pool-registration/import using the same `clamp(50 + normal(seed)*20, 0, 100)` distribution the prospect path
  uses — simplest, spec-consistent, *Captain lean*; **(b)** derive them from the visible personality + ratings (so
  recognizable players get characterful modifiers); **(c)** add them to the `playerDatabase` SOT (touches a
  protected source-of-truth). This touches the SMB4 personality asset + possibly the SOT → flagged for your ruling
  rather than defaulted. **L1.5 is SET ASIDE until you rule OD-1.** (Once ruled, OD-1 itself is a small build, then
  L1.5 follows.)
  **→ RESOLVED 2026-06-16 (built with default (a), commit below):** modifiers generated at franchise-init,
  seeded by `player.id`, same distribution as prospects, no SOT touch; L1.5 Captain assignment shipped on top.
  Override the distribution on return if you'd prefer (b) derive-from-personality or (c) SOT.

- **OD-2 (MED — L-ECON1 salary scale) — sequencing + taper + frozen-anchor scope.** DSF-1 re-prices the same
  `computeIV` curve-block the frozen draft-IV baseline + D4 salary + D6 trusted-value read. Decisions: **(i)**
  scope L-ECON1 to **new-league construction only** (never re-prices an already-frozen franchise) vs land it
  **before** the v1 franchise's draft/salary freeze (ahead of D4/D6 in the build calendar) — *Captain lean:
  new-league-construction-only is the safest, but it must still precede the freeze for the v1 league*; **(ii)**
  taper = the `pickValueChart` IS the taper (pick N → chart[N-1]) vs a separate MLB/farm taper — *Captain lean:
  the chart IS the taper*; **(iii)** confirm IV-curve tier sensitivity = scale raw IVs before the chart (NOT a
  computeIV input — keeps §3.9 / the frozen oracle untouched). Rookie/farm pricing pegs to the tier-scaled
  `chart[0]`. Not built (value-sensitive + sequencing-coupled to unbuilt D4/D6).

- **OD-3 (L2 mutable layer — two-tier confirmation UX).** Greenfield; the product-UX is the crux: **(i)** does a
  pending ratings/trait confirmation **BLOCK** further games or run **async-background**? *(Captain lean: async,
  non-blocking — a 100-game season can't gate on a confirm)*; **(ii)** console-edit instruction format — plain
  text ("Power 65→70 on X") vs structured vs clipboard command? *(lean: plain text)*; **(iii)** temp-overlay
  expiry = **game-count** (re-evaluated on load) vs absolute timestamp? *(lean: game-count — the season clock is
  games, not wall-time)*; **(iv)** overlays season-scoped vs carry-forward. The store/read-path/parity are
  mechanical once these are ruled. Map in `wf_7b56fa48-a58`.

- **OD-4 (L4a reporter base-connect + publish bus).** **(i)** franchiseId-vs-leagueId reporter scope rule
  (exclusive vs franchiseId-precedence cascade)? *(lean: cascade — franchiseId wins for franchise games)*;
  **(ii)** `ReporterAssignmentPanel` UI placement — season-setup modal vs pregame screen? *(your UX call)*;
  **(iii)** `SeasonNewsItem.facts` schema (the §5 fact dict the reporter renders). SEA-3 already ruled
  (SeasonNewsItem + reuse rivalryScores). Map in `wf_7b56fa48-a58`.

- **OD-5 (L9a trait enrichment capture).** **(i)** manual vs auto capture for pitch-zone / pitch-type /
  OF-extra-base-credit — manual = sparse data → "Franchise-lite" (some enrichment-detail traits stay dormant via
  the §VI.1 min-sample valve); auto needs a reliable SMB4 read. *(Captain lean: manual/opt-in is spec-consistent —
  L9a just ENABLES capture; L9b gates on min-sample — so sparse is acceptable, no blocker)*; **(ii)** injury
  accumulator = cumulative season tally (for Durable/Injury-Prone) vs per-event snapshot? *(lean: cumulative
  season tally)*. Touches the live game path (useGameState/GameTracker) → wanted your eyes before building.
  Map in `wf_7b56fa48-a58`.

## CONSERVATIVE DEFAULTS TAKEN (AUTH-2 — documented, continued; override any on return)

- **L1:** no data-migration for old saved data (pre-launch; live consumers are presence-only; no by-key reader
  exists until the unbuilt L3). Field typed fully as `HiddenPersonalityModifiers`.
- **D1:** left the season-CREATION game count (`getOrCreateSeason` line 359) out of scope — it's a separate
  concern from WAR-scaling and would need franchise-schedule threading.
- **D2:** `KBL_BACKUP_VERSION` left at 2 (bumping breaks existing backups via the restore guard); parity-guard
  scoped to the `kbl-tracker` DB only (the all-DB extension + syncConfig/manifest reconciliation = a separate
  hardening ticket).

## TICKET LOG

- **2026-06-16 — RUN INITIALIZED.** Baseline committed (design docs + this protocol). Codex CLI verified.
  Queue per protocol: D2 → L9a → L1 → L1.5 → D1 (mechanical, auto-commit); L-ECON1 (build, hold); then L2, L4a.
  Next action: map the mechanical batch (parallel read-only workflow) → draft contracts → begin Codex builds.

- **2026-06-16 — MAPS COMPLETE** (workflow `wf_7b56fa48-a58`, 8 mappers). Triage after reading all 8 maps —
  the "mechanical" tickets split by judgment-density:
  - **BUILD + auto-commit:** **L1** (rename — FIRST, validates the loop), **L1.5** (Captain, after L1),
    **D1** (162 WAR-scaling closure — mostly already wired, 3-line change + grep gate), **D2** (backup parity —
    SCOPED: register the 3 stores + bump the kbl-tracker pin 12→15 + the all-DB parity-guard + a round-trip
    test; EXCLUDE the L2-dependent temp-overlay-expiry test and the export/restore-UI wiring [separate
    hardening ticket]).
  - **BUILD + HOLD for JK (do NOT commit):** **L-ECON1** (re-prices the frozen draft-IV anchor — value-sensitive).
  - **SET ASIDE for JK** (contracts to draft; these carry genuine product/UX decisions beyond conservative
    defaults): **L2** (two-tier confirmation UX — console-edit format, blocking-vs-async, temp-overlay expiry
    semantics; 9 open questions), **L4a** (reporter UI placement + franchiseId-vs-leagueId scope rule +
    SeasonNewsItem.facts schema), **L9a** (manual-vs-auto capture for pitch-zone/type/OF-credit + injury-
    accumulator scope; touches the live game path). See OPEN DECISIONS section when these are written up.
  - **STARTED: L1.** Contract appended to PROMPT_CONTRACTS.md; Codex invoked (high reasoning, workspace-write).

- **2026-06-16 — L1 COMMITTED.** Codex built (exit 0); Captain (Opus) independent audit = **VERIFIED** (triangle:
  builder=Codex, auditor=Opus). Diff = 3 ALLOWED source files (`HiddenPersonalityModifiers` rename
  loyalty/ambition/resilience/charisma + the typed `Player.hiddenPersonalityModifiers` field + the carrier type)
  + 20 test files (pure fixture-key + leak-regex renames; Codex grepped beyond the named set — all within the
  "test files referencing old keys" contract clause). **Independent gates:** `tsc --noEmit` = 0; `grep` for old
  keys in src/ = 0; `prospectScoutingDraftEngine` 14/14; `franchiseNarrativeEventEligibility` 10 pass / 1 fail =
  ONLY the characterized "TEAM_MVP/ACE preview-only" (not a new break); `npm run build` 0 (Codex, corroborated by
  tsc 0). No behavior change, no oracle/value touch, no out-of-ALLOWED edits. Conservative default applied: no
  data migration (pre-launch; presence-only live consumers). **→ NEXT: L1.5 (Captain assignment).**

- **2026-06-16 — L1.5 SET ASIDE (blocked on OD-1).** Pre-contract verification found MLB pool players lack the
  hidden modifiers (assigned only in the prospect path) → Captain selection would be a no-op. Escalated as **OD-1**
  (above) — an SMB4-personality-asset decision for JK. Not built. **→ NEXT: D1 (162 WAR-scaling closure — modifier-
  independent).**

- **2026-06-16 — STARTED: D1.** Pre-contract analysis: WAR scaling already routes through stored `gamesPerTeam`
  (`resolveSeasonGamesForWAR`); the `/ 162` division gate is already green; only the `= 162` literal at
  `useSeasonStats.ts:38` remains → D1 = a ZERO-behavior-change alias to canonical `MLB_BASELINE_GAMES` (the
  `seasonAggregator.ts:39` pattern). Season-CREATION game count (line 359) noted OUT of scope (separate concern).
  Contract in PROMPT_CONTRACTS.md; Codex invoked.

- **2026-06-16 — D1 COMMITTED.** Codex built (exit 0); Captain audit = **VERIFIED**. Diff = `useSeasonStats.ts`
  only (`import { MLB_BASELINE_GAMES }` + line 38 alias). **ZERO behavior change** — `MLB_BASELINE_GAMES === 162`
  (confirmed `franchiseAdaptiveStandards.ts:8`); WAR scaling already routed through `gamesPerTeam`. Independent
  gates: tsc 0; grep `= 162|/ 162|* 162` in useSeasonStats = 0; seasonLength 7/7; Codex's 5-file WAR gate 305/305
  (it found the real pwar/fwar/rwar paths under `src_figma/__tests__/statCalculations/`). Season-creation game
  count (line 359) left out-of-scope (separate concern). **→ NEXT: D2 (backup parity, scoped).**

- **2026-06-16 — STARTED: D2.** Pre-contract reads pinned the exact mirror (trackerDb.ts 3 store defs) + the
  registry shape + the version anchors. **Key ruling (documented):** do NOT bump `KBL_BACKUP_VERSION` (stays 2) —
  restore REJECTS backups whose version ≠ KBL_BACKUP_VERSION (`backupRestore.ts:1232/1253`), and the file FORMAT
  is unchanged (only store COVERAGE grows); bumping would break every existing backup. Only the kbl-tracker
  SCHEMA pin goes 12→15. Scope: register the 3 stores + the pin + a parity-guard (kbl-tracker only) + round-trip
  test. OUT of D2 (→ separate hardening ticket): the all-DB guard extension, syncConfig/manifest reconciliation,
  export/restore UI wiring, the L2-expiry test. Contract in PROMPT_CONTRACTS.md; Codex invoked.

- **2026-06-16 — D2 COMMITTED.** Codex built (exit 0); Captain audit = **VERIFIED**. Diff = `backupRestore.ts`
  (3 stores added to `trackerStores` mirroring trackerDb EXACTLY — keyPaths + indexes +
  `franchiseTrueValueRows.by_player_scope` unique via `options:{unique:true}`; pin `12→15` line 298) + NEW
  `backupRestore.franchiseParity.test.ts`. **`KBL_BACKUP_VERSION` UNCHANGED at 2** (confirmed — the ruling held).
  Test is mutation-honest: parity-guard = real `objectStoreNames === registry-keys` set comparison (would've
  failed pre-D2); round-trip seeds → exports → **WIPES the DB** → restores → reads each row back by composite key.
  Parity-guard passed without revealing other missing stores → the 3 were the COMPLETE gap (D2 fully closes the
  silent-drop defect). Independent gates: tsc 0; parity (2) + elimination (10) = 12 passed. SMB4 assets untouched;
  backup/restore still orphaned (UI wiring + all-DB guard = the separate hardening ticket). **→ NEXT: L-ECON1
  (build + HOLD — value-sensitive, do NOT commit).**

- **2026-06-16 — L-ECON1 SET ASIDE (revised from build-and-hold) → OD-2.** On reflection: it re-prices the
  frozen draft-IV anchor on the IV/salary value spine, carries value-design open questions, and is
  sequencing-coupled to the unbuilt D4/D6 — no urgency, and building it unwatched would bake value defaults on
  the protected spine. Set aside with OD-2.

- **2026-06-16 — AUTONOMOUS BUILD PHASE WRAPPED.** Safe-mechanical set complete: **L1 + D1 + D2 committed** (all
  VERIFIED). Remaining Tier-0 work is design/value/product-laden → 5 open decisions (OD-1..5) surfaced for JK; the
  loop resumes on his rulings. No pushes; tree clean except the pre-existing `Temp/` + roster CSV. Triangle held
  throughout (Codex built every diff; Opus audited every diff independently — tsc/tests re-run, not trusted from
  the builder paste). Next watched session: D4 (salary-live UI de-gate) is the natural first build (browser-
  verifiable), and OD-1 (the cheapest unblock) lets L1.5 + the modifier-consuming layer proceed.

- **2026-06-16 — RUN RESUMED (recalibration).** JK flagged the wrap was too conservative: AUTH-2 authorized "make
  a conservative choice AND CONTINUE (and document)" — I'd over-applied the "set aside" branch. Recalibrated: build
  with documented conservative defaults; HALT only on genuine frozen-value-oracle touches or truly new design the
  spec doesn't cover. **OD-1 reclassified "halt" → BUILD with default (a)** — the spec already says all players
  carry the 4 modifiers, so generating them at init is building-to-spec (no SOT touch). Combined OD-1 + L1.5 into
  ONE franchise-init ticket (shared file). **STARTED: L1.5+OD-1.** Contract in PROMPT_CONTRACTS.md; Codex invoked.
  Queue after: L9a, L2, L4a with their logged leans; **L-ECON1 remains HELD** (frozen draft-IV anchor = a real
  hard-halt trigger).

- **2026-06-16 — L1.5+OD-1 COMMITTED.** Codex built (exit 0); Captain audit = **VERIFIED**. Diff:
  `prospectScoutingDraftEngine.ts` (extract+export `generateHiddenPersonalityModifiers(seed)`, output-preserving
  refactor of buildCandidate) · `franchiseInitializer.ts` (backfill = skip-if-present, seed=player.id; captains =
  max(loyalty+charisma), charisma≥70, MLB-only, null+warn, deterministic ties; wired backfill→captains→season-
  metadata, captains consume the backfilled players) · `leagueBuilderStorage.ts` (`captainPlayerId?: string|null`
  on Team, additive) · NEW `franchiseInitializer.test.ts` (4 mutation-honest tests incl. a FARM-with-highest-raw-
  score exclusion + a charisma-69 gate-out) + w1fix ordering test. **Invariants confirmed:** designation
  eligibility NOT unblocked (L7 owns activation) · playerDatabase SOT NOT touched · prospect output unchanged.
  Independent gates: tsc 0; my 3 unit files 21/21; **the 3 end-to-end initializeFranchise integration tests 33/33
  (no regression to the init path)**. **→ NEXT: L9a (trait enrichment capture, manual/opt-in default).**
