## HOW TO READ THIS FILE

- Findings are numbered sequentially: FINDING-001, FINDING-002, etc.
- Status meanings:
  - **CONFIRMED** — verified by real test or browser check
  - **CONTRADICTED** — code does NOT match what spec/handoff claims
  - **UNVERIFIED** — not yet tested; do not treat as working
- Never change a past finding's status. Add a new FINDING that supersedes it.
