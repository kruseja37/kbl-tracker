---

## Recent Fixes (February 3, 2026 Late Night)

### Legacy vs Figma Codebase Audit Complete
- **Finding**: Figma codebase (`src/src_figma/`) cross-imports from legacy (`src/`) via relative paths
- **Architecture**: Integration wrappers in Figma adapt legacy engine APIs for React hooks
- **Status**: ✅ 42 TypeScript build errors FIXED, build now passes

### Files Fixed (API Mismatches)
| File | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| `agingIntegration.ts` | Wrong signature for `processEndOfSeasonAging` | Pass `{overall: rating}` object |
| `useAgingData.ts` | Used `result.retired` instead of `result.shouldRetire` | Updated property names |
| `fanMoraleIntegration.ts` | Wrong FanState enum values | ELECTRIC→EUPHORIC, etc. |
| `useFanMorale.ts` | 21 errors, not imported anywhere | Stubbed out |
| `useMWARCalculations.ts` | Wrong import path, wrong param order | Fixed paths and signature |
| `mwarIntegration.ts` | Return type void vs object | Return copy after mutation |

## Recent Fixes (February 3, 2026)

### Current Batter/Pitcher Display - Now Live
- **Problem**: Display boxes showed hardcoded "J. MARTINEZ" and "R. SMITH"
- **Fix**: Now pulls from `gameState.currentBatterId/Name` and `playerStats/pitcherStats` Maps
- **Location**: `src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx` lines 368-393, 1232-1282
- **Shows**: Batter name, position, grade, H-AB stats | Pitcher name, pitch count

### Pitcher Substitution - Now Working
- **Problem**: Pitching change from roster only logged to console, didn't update state
- **Fix**: `handlePitcherSubstitution` now calls `changePitcher()` hook
- **Flow**: TeamRoster → handlePitcherSubstitution → changePitcher → PitchCountModal → confirm → state update
- **Location**: `src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx` lines 704-712

### Previous Bugs Fixed (This Session, Pre-Compaction)
- ✅ SB with multiple runners - uses batch runner moves
- ✅ Walk classified correctly (type: 'walk' not 'hit')
- ✅ Fly out with runner thrown out - counts all outs
- ✅ Fame event deduplication - no repeated milestones
- ✅ Game initialization with lineups - batters have unique IDs

---

## Recent Fixes (February 2, 2026 Late Night)

### Runner Icon Sync Bug Fix
- **Problem**: Runner icons didn't always end up where they should after plays
- **Root Cause**: `recordOut` in `useGameState.ts` was not updating `bases` state from `runnerData` parameter
- **Fix**: Added base state management in `recordOut` to clear origin bases and set destination bases
- **Location**: `src/src_figma/hooks/useGameState.ts` lines 1043-1064

### Hook Wiring Complete
- `usePlayerState` and `useFameTracking` hooks now wired into GameTracker.tsx
- Fame Event Popup (top-right) shows detected fame events with LI tier
- Player State Notifications (top-left) shows Mojo/Fitness changes
- Mojo updates triggered on: HOME_RUN, SINGLE, DOUBLE, TRIPLE, STRIKEOUT

## GameTracker 5-Step UX Flow 📋 NEWLY IMPLEMENTED

### Overview
A new 5-step UX flow has been integrated into the Enhanced Interactive Field. This provides cleaner button placement and more intuitive play recording.

### 5-Step Flow
```
Step 1: IDLE           → ActionSelector shows HIT/OUT/OTHER in left foul corner
Step 2: HIT_LOCATION   → Click field overlay to set hit location
        OUT_FIELDING   → Drag fielder + tap throw sequence + ADVANCE button
Step 3: HIT_OUTCOME    → OutcomeButtons (1B/2B/3B/HR + modifiers) in right foul corner
        OUT_OUTCOME    → OutcomeButtons (GO/FO/LO/K/etc + modifiers) in right foul corner
Step 4: RUNNER_CONFIRM → RunnerOutcomesDisplay (existing component)
Step 5: END_CONFIRM    → END AT-BAT button (existing component)
```

### New Components
| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `ActionSelector.tsx` | Left foul corner | Step 1 - HIT/OUT/OTHER buttons |
| `OutcomeButtons.tsx` | Right foul corner | Step 3 - Multi-select outcome buttons |

### FlowStep State Machine
```typescript
type FlowStep =
  | 'IDLE'              // Step 1: Waiting for HIT/OUT/OTHER selection
  | 'HIT_LOCATION'      // Step 2 (HIT): Waiting for field click
  | 'OUT_FIELDING'      // Step 2 (OUT): Waiting for fielder drag + sequence
  | 'HIT_OUTCOME'       // Step 3 (HIT): Showing hit outcome buttons
  | 'OUT_OUTCOME'       // Step 3 (OUT): Showing out outcome buttons
  | 'RUNNER_CONFIRM'    // Step 4: Confirming runner outcomes
  | 'END_CONFIRM';      // Step 5: End at-bat confirmation
```

### ActionSelector OTHER Menu
Expands to: BB, IBB, HBP, D3K, SB, CS, PK, TBL, PB, WP, E

### OutcomeButtons Options
**HIT Mode:**
- Types: 1B, 2B, 3B, HR
- Modifiers: BUNT, IS (Infield Single), 7+
- Specials: KP (Killed Pitcher), NUT (Nut Shot)

**OUT Mode:**
- Types: GO, FO, LO, PO, FLO, K, KL, DP, FC
- Modifiers: SF, SAC, IFR, RD, E, 7+
- Specials: WEB (Web Gem)

### Implementation Status
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| ActionSelector component | ✅ Complete |
| OutcomeButtons component | ✅ Complete |
| FlowStep state machine | ✅ Complete |
| Visual prompts for each step | ✅ Complete |
| Integration with existing RunnerOutcomesDisplay | ✅ Complete |
| Integration with existing END AT-BAT | ✅ Complete |

## GameTracker Redesign - Drag-Drop Paradigm 📋 SPEC COMPLETE

### Specification v4 Complete
A comprehensive specification (~770 lines) has been created for the drag-and-drop GameTracker redesign.

**See**: `spec-docs/GAMETRACKER_DRAGDROP_SPEC.md` for full details.

### Core Design Decisions (v4)
1. **Continuous coordinate system** - Field is (0,0) to (1.0, 1.4) including stands
2. **Drag fielder to ball location** - Captures spray chart, then tap throw sequence
3. **Tap fielder sequence** (5-3, 6-4-3) - Implies throws between fielders
4. **Foul territory auto-detected** - `isFoulTerritory(x,y) = |x-0.5| > y×0.5`
5. **Two HR methods** - Drag past fence (fun) OR HR button (quick)
6. **Substitutions via lineup card** - NOT field dragging (prevents accidents)
7. **Undo button only** - 5-step stack, no gestures (prevents accidents)
8. **Special events** auto-detected (Killed Pitcher, Nutshot, Web Gem, Foul Out)

### Reconciliation Strategy
| Keep from Original | Replace | Add New |
|--------------------|---------|---------|
| Data layer (hooks, storage) | Button-based UI | Continuous coordinates |
| Calculation engines | Modal dialogs | Foul territory geometry |
| Play recording functions | Separate fielding panel | Lineup card subs |
| | | Undo system |

### Implementation Status (8 Phases)
| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Extended Field Canvas | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Phase 2 | Batter Drag-Drop | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Phase 3 | Fielder Drag-Drop | ✅ COMPLETE (via Phase 2) |
| Phase 4 | Play Classification | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Phase 5 | Runner Events | ✅ COMPLETE (RunnerDragDrop.tsx) |
| Phase 6 | Substitution System | ✅ COMPLETE (LineupCard.tsx) |
| Phase 7 | Undo System | ✅ COMPLETE (UndoSystem.tsx) |
| Phase 8 | Data Layer & Polish | ⚠️ PARTIAL (wiring improvements made Jan 31) |

> **Audit Note (2026-01-31)**: Previous documentation incorrectly claimed Phases 5-7 were "Not Started".
> See `DRAGDROP_AUDIT_2026-01-31.md` for full audit details.

## Phase 6 Progress - Finalize & Polish ⏳

### Integration Testing & Fixes (In Progress)

**Critical Integration Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Season number persistence** - `currentSeason` now stored in localStorage and increments on advance
2. ✅ **Offseason flow props** - All flows now receive consistent `seasonId` and `seasonNumber` props
3. ✅ **Header display** - FranchiseHome header shows correct season number from state
4. ✅ **Fallback strings** - Hardcoded "Season 2" fallbacks updated to use dynamic `currentSeason`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/src_figma/app/pages/FranchiseHome.tsx` - Season state management, prop passing

**Franchise Lifecycle Flow (Verified):**
```
League Builder → Create League/Teams/Players
     ↓
FranchiseHome (Regular Season) → Add games, track stats
     ↓
FranchiseHome (Playoffs) → Create playoff, track series
     ↓ [PROCEED TO OFFSEASON button, requires playoffs complete]
FranchiseHome (Offseason) → Awards → Ratings → Retirements → FA → Draft → Trades
     ↓
FinalizeAdvanceFlow → Roster management → Spring Training → Advance
     ↓ [Increments currentSeason, persists to localStorage]
FranchiseHome (Regular Season) → New season begins
```

## Project Overview

**What is this?**: A baseball stat-tracking application designed for **Super Mega Baseball 4 (SMB4)**, a video game with unique mechanics. This distinction matters because:
- No catcher interference, balk detection, or umpire judgment calls
- User manually selects all outcomes (the game tells them what happened)
- DH rules and substitutions still apply (user can remove DH)
- Kids league rules do NOT apply

---

## Implementation Status

| **Total WAR** | ✅ Complete | Position: bWAR+fWAR+rWAR; Pitcher: pWAR+(bWAR×0.1) |

**Day 2 v2 Fix (Jan 25, 2026)**: Connected bWAR/pWAR calculators to real persisted season data via `useWARCalculations` hook. Created display components for WAR leaderboards.

**Day 1 IMPL_PLAN_v5 (Jan 26, 2026)**: Connected fWAR and rWAR calculators to useWARCalculations hook. Added conversion functions, state maps, getters, and total WAR calculation combining all components.

**Day 2 IMPL_PLAN_v5 (Jan 26, 2026)**: Wired Clutch and mWAR systems to UI:
- Added "Clutch" tab to WARPanel (`WARDisplay.tsx`) with ClutchLeaderboard component
- Wired `useClutchCalculations` hook into GameTracker - records clutch events for both batter and pitcher after each at-bat
- Wired `useMWARCalculations` hook into GameTracker - records manager decisions (pitching changes, pinch hitters, etc.) for mWAR tracking
- Browser tested: Clutch tab appears and displays "No clutch data yet" until at-bats are recorded

**SMB4 Baselines Used (from ADAPTIVE_STANDARDS_ENGINE_SPEC.md):**
- League wOBA: 0.329, wOBA Scale: 1.7821
- League FIP: 4.04, FIP constant: 3.28
- Replacement Level: -12.0 runs per 600 PA (batters), 0.12/0.03 (starter/reliever)
- **WAR Runs Per Win: 10 × (seasonGames / 162)** — e.g., 50 games = 3.09 RPW
- SB value: +0.20, CS value: -0.45, break-even: 69%

> ⚠️ **Note**: The 17.87 "runsPerWin" in ADAPTIVE_STANDARDS is for run environment analysis (Pythagorean expectation), NOT for WAR. See SESSION_LOG "CRITICAL BUG FIX" entry.

- **bWAR**: wOBA → wRAA → replacement adjustment → park factor → WAR
- **pWAR**: FIP → runs prevented above replacement → WAR (with leverage)
- **fWAR**: per-play runs × position modifier × difficulty → positional adjustment → WAR
- **rWAR**: BsR (wSB + UBR + wGDP) / runsPerWin

| All Tests | ✅ Complete | `fame-detection-verify.cjs` - 25/25 passing |

**Key Calculations:**
- **Fame Value**: baseFame × √LI × playoffMultiplier
- **LI Multiplier**: √LI (LI=4 → 2×, LI=9 → 3×)
- **Fame Tiers**: Notorious (-30), Villain, Disliked, Unknown, Known, Fan Favorite, Star, Superstar, Legend (50+)
- **Save Opportunity**: Lead ≤3 OR tying run on base/at bat, 7th inning or later

**Milestone Threshold Architecture (Runtime Scaling):**
- **MLB Baseline Thresholds** are stored in code (40 HR, 200 hits, etc.) - These create meaning
- **MilestoneConfig** holds franchise settings: `gamesPerSeason`, `inningsPerGame`
- **Runtime Scaling** via `scaleMilestoneThreshold()` in fameEngine.ts
- **Scaling Types**:
  - `'opportunity'`: games × innings (gamesPerSeason/162 × inningsPerGame/9)
    - Used for: HR, hits, RBI, SB, pitcher K, walks, errors, WAR, etc.
    - Rationale: More innings per game = more plate appearances/chances
  - `'per-game'`: season length only (gamesPerSeason / 162)
    - Used for: Wins, losses, saves, blown saves, complete games, games played
    - Rationale: Max 1 per game regardless of game length
  - `'none'`: No scaling
    - Used for: Awards (All-Star, MVP, Cy Young) - 1 per season max
- **Rate stats** (BA, ERA) use same thresholds as MLB (no scaling needed)
- **Example - 32g/9inn season**: 40 HR MLB × (32/162 × 9/9) = 40 × 0.198 = 8 HR threshold
- **Example - 32g/7inn season**: 40 HR MLB × (32/162 × 7/9) = 40 × 0.154 = 6 HR threshold

**Existing UI Integration:**
- FameEventModal for manual Fame entry (all event types)
- QuickFameButtons for common events (Nut Shot, TOOTBLAN, Web Gem, etc.)
- FamePanel for in-game Fame display
- Toast notifications for auto-detected events
- EndGameFameSummary for post-game

**Design Philosophy Documented:**
- Updated `REQUIREMENTS.md` - User Interaction Model section rewritten
- Updated `AI_OPERATING_PREFERENCES.md` - Added Section 13 "GameTracker Design Philosophy"
- Detection Tiers: Auto-Detect (no input), Prompt-Detect (1-click), Manual Entry (rare)

## WAR Calculation Implementation Phases

> **Future-proofing note**: This section documents what advanced metrics can be calculated now vs. what requires enhanced tracking. Each spec file has detailed implementation notes.

### Summary Table

| **mWAR** | Team overperformance | ✅ Ready | Wins vs salary expectation | MWAR_CALCULATION_SPEC.md §6 |

### Phase 1 (Calculate Now)
These metrics can be implemented with current tracking:
- **Full bWAR**: wOBA, wRAA, replacement level adjustment
- **Basic fWAR**: Per-play credits for putouts, assists, errors, DPs
- **Partial rWAR**: wSB (stolen bases) + wGDP (double play avoidance)
- **Full pWAR**: FIP, starter/reliever split, real LI-based leverage multiplier
- **Full Clutch System**: LI calculation, multi-participant attribution, contact quality, Net Clutch Rating
- **Full mWAR**: Manager decision tracking (auto-inferred), LI-weighted evaluation, team overperformance

### Phase 2 (Requires Enhanced Tracking)
These need additional UI/schema work:
- **Full fWAR**: DP role tracking (started/turned/completed), new play types
- **Full rWAR (UBR)**: Runner advancement opportunities, extra bases taken, thrown out advancing
- **Park factors**: For pWAR park adjustment
- **Full mWAR prompts**: User-prompted steal/bunt/squeeze calls (currently defaults to player autonomy)

### Schema Additions Defined But Not Implemented
See FIELDING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md and RWAR_CALCULATION_SPEC.md for ready-to-implement schemas:
- `dpRole`: 'started' | 'turned' | 'completed' | 'unassisted'
- `RunnerAdvancement`: advancementType, couldHaveAdvanced, wasThrown
- Enhanced play types: running, sliding, over_shoulder
