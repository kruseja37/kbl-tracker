# CURRENT_STATE.md

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-16
**Phase:** GameTracker UX redesign COMPLETE — pre-integration testing

---

## Current Phase

The GameTracker UX redesign is **COMPLETE**. All 58 decisions from GAMETRACKER_UX_SPEC.md have been addressed: 48 implemented, 10 verified as already existing or N/A.

The immediate next step is full integration testing: play a complete game start to finish on iPad Safari landscape using the new UX.

Current priorities:

1. Full game playtest on iPad Safari landscape (start to finish)
2. Fix any issues found during playtest
3. Resume Elimination Mode Steps 6-14 (paused during UX redesign)
4. Wire season stats to player card (currently shows game stats only)
5. Wire fWAR/pWAR to lineup columns (currently "—" placeholders)

## What Was Built (UX Redesign Session — 2026-03-15/16)

### Tier 1 — Architectural Rewrite (14 items)
- 4-column layout: NewsBoard (1/5), Batting Lineup (1/5), Defensive Lineup (1/5), Play Log (2/5)
- ScoreBug single-line at top with expand/collapse retro Fenway overlay
- GameDiamond removed from render (file preserved)
- Inline lineup columns: 9 players each, role-based swapping on half-inning
- Three-phase lifecycle: PRE_GAME → LIVE → POST_FINAL_OUT with START GAME gate
- Fixed viewport, no page scroll, internal column scrolling only
- Balls/strikes removed from scoreboard

### Tier 2 — Component Rewrites (20 items)
- K and Ꝁ (backwards K) as separate Quick Bar buttons
- ITPHR in overflow menu
- Undo + End Game in Quick Bar row with visual divider
- Processing-aware button feedback
- Pre-commit runner correction gate removed — immediate commit with defaults
- Player-first substitution flow (tap player → card → Sub Out → bench list)
- Real game stats wired to player card (season stats deferred)
- Enrichment taxonomy rewritten: contactType replaces exitType, fielding attempt restructured (Type + Outcome), play mechanic separated, per-result gating
- Inline SVG spray graphic with context-sensitive zone counts
- Manager moment Ⓜ in ScoreBug with Stay the Course button
- NewsBoard verified display-only
- Half-inning column swap verified

### Tier 3 — Polish & New Features (14 items)
- Runner sub-entries in play log with "└" nesting, independently enrichable
- Runner enrichment: TOOTBLAN, Out Advancing, fielding sequence, play mechanic per runner
- currentCatcherId auto-assigned on BetweenPlayEvents
- Undo-depth-aware locking (within 10 = full correction, beyond = structural locked, enrichment open)
- Defensive lineup enrichment mode (column toggles to "FIELDING SEQUENCE")
- Spray zone counts match spec §8.2 exactly
- Pitch count triggers verified at all 3 points
- Play log team colors
- CSS animations (fade-in, score highlight, lineup row flash)
- Player card initiate-only enforcement
- Audio system (Web Audio API, 8-bit retro sounds, two toggles)
- Undo toast format: "[inning] [batter] [result]"
- Save indicator ✓/⚠ in ScoreBug
- Locked result tooltip on tap

## Known Gaps (Not Regressions — Deferred Items)

| Gap | Status | What's Needed |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| FLO outcome silently dropped | Pre-existing bug | Add FLO to buildRunnerCorrectionForQuickBarOutcome out-type list |
| Season stats not on player card | Deferred | Wire franchise data store season aggregates to PlayerCardModal |
| Jersey numbers not shown | Data gap | Player interface doesn't include jersey number field |
| fWAR/pWAR show "—" | Deferred | Wire WAR calculation pipeline to lineup column display |
| Defensive next-inning leadoff | Simplified | Cross-half-inning batter tracking needs refinement |
| Manager moment detection | Infrastructure only | leverageIndex > 2.0 threshold trigger not wired (Ⓜ ready) |

## Architecture Truth (Updated)

### Layout
- 3-row pinned layout: ScoreBug (top), 4-column content (middle), QuickBar (bottom)
- Columns: NewsBoard, BattingLineupColumn, DefensiveLineupColumn, PlayLogPanel

- Fielding Attempt: Type (8 options) + Outcome (Made/Missed)
- Play Mechanic: separate dimension (6 options including Deflection)
- Per-result ENRICHMENT_CONFIG gating
- Runner-level enrichment: TOOTBLAN, Out Advancing, fielding seq, play mechanic
- Inline SVG spray graphic with result-specific zone counts

### Substitution
- Player-first flow: tap player → card → Sub Out → bench list → select
- Swap Position and Swap Order (pre-game only) via player card
- Drag-drop substitution removed

### Score Bug
- Single-line with expand/collapse Fenway overlay
- Ⓜ manager moment indicator + Stay the Course button
- ✓/⚠ save indicator
