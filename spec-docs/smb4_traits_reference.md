# SMB4 Traits Reference for KBL XHD Tracker

## Trait System Overview

Each trait is tied to a Chemistry type. Trait potency depends on how many players share that Chemistry:
- **Tier 1** (0-2 players): Minimal bonus
- **Tier 2** (3-6 players): Mid-level bonus
- **Tier 3** (7+ players): Maximum bonus

## Trait Interaction Rules

> **Added January 23, 2026** to resolve NFL Audit Issue 2.22

### How Conflicting Traits Interact

When two players with "opposing" traits face each other (e.g., Stealer vs Pick Officer), traits apply **independently** to their respective owners:

| Situation | Trait A (Runner) | Trait B (Pitcher) | Result |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Steal attempt | Stealer (+speed) | Pick Officer (-steal speed) | Both effects apply, partially canceling |
| Steal attempt | Stealer (+speed) | None | Runner gets full Stealer bonus |
| Steal attempt | None | Pick Officer | Runner suffers full Pick Officer penalty |

**Rule: Traits are ADDITIVE, not canceling.**

### Math Example: Stealer vs Pick Officer (Tier 2 vs Tier 2)
```
Base steal speed: 100
Stealer bonus: ×2 → 200 effective speed
Pick Officer penalty: ×2 reduction → 200 / 2 = 100 effective speed

Result: Both Tier 2 traits → net effect ~neutral (back to baseline)
```

### Edge Cases

| Opposing Traits | Resolution |
|----------------|------------|
| Specialist (same-hand penalty) vs RBI Hero (clutch bonus) | Both apply independently |
| Mind Gamer (-ACC to pitcher) vs K Collector (+VEL/JNK) | Both apply; pitcher has worse ACC but better stuff |
| First Pitch Slayer vs First Pitch Prayer | Impossible - same player can't have both |
| Cannon Arm vs Noodle Arm | Impossible - same player can't have both |

### Key Principle
SMB4 traits modify the individual player's capabilities. When Player A's trait affects Player B, it's applied as a modifier to Player B's action - but Player B's own traits also apply. **No trait is ever "nullified" - all applicable modifiers stack.**
