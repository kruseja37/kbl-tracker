# KBL TRACKER — PROMPT CONTRACTS
# Created: 2026-02-17
# Standard templates for all Codex prompts. Never deviate from this format.

---

## Why Prompt Contracts Matter

Vague prompts produce vague results. Every Codex prompt must:
- Define a single, scoped role
- Reference the exact source of truth
- List exact files to touch AND files to avoid
- Define what "done" looks like before Codex starts
- Include hard stops for ambiguity

A prompt without these elements will produce code that looks right and breaks something else.

---

## THE MASTER TEMPLATE

```
You are [Specific Role, e.g., "the GameTracker Reducer Migration Specialist"].

GOAL:
[One sentence describing exactly what needs to be done. No more.]

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
[Exact file path(s) or FINDING-NNN from AUDIT_LOG.md that defines correct behavior]
Quote the relevant section or finding verbatim if it affects your changes.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only edit these files: [list exact paths, one per line]
- Do NOT touch: [list exact paths, one per line]
- Do NOT add new dependencies
- Do NOT rename existing functions or types
- Do NOT change behavior beyond the stated goal
- Work directly on main branch (no new branches or worktrees)
- Reference the exact FINDING-NNN or spec ID for every change you make

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
[Describe exactly what the code should look like or do after this change.
Be specific: function signatures, state shape, guard conditions, etc.]

VERIFICATION:
Run these exact commands and paste the output:
1. [e.g., npm run build]
2. [e.g., grep -n "isRehydrated" src/src_figma/hooks/useGamePersistence.ts]
3. [e.g., npx vitest run src/src_figma/__tests__/gameTracker/AtBatFlow.test.tsx]

FORMAT — Your response must contain exactly these sections:
1. FILES CHANGED: [list exact paths]
2. CHANGES MADE: [describe each change, reference FINDING-NNN or spec ID]
3. VERIFICATION OUTPUT: [paste exact command output]
4. STATUS: "[Task name] complete" OR "BLOCKED: [exact reason and what you need]"

FAILURE PROTOCOL:
- If anything is ambiguous → quote the exact ambiguous section and stop
- If you cannot open a file → stop and report the exact filename
- If a required change is in a file not listed in CONSTRAINTS → stop and report
- If tests fail after your change → stop, report which tests, paste the failure output
- Never summarize changes — describe each one specifically
- Never batch unrelated changes into one response
- Never assume intent — ask

Use HIGH reasoning effort. Think step-by-step before writing any code.
```

## EXAMPLE CONTRACTS (Reference These When Building New Ones)

### Example 1: Targeted Bug Fix

```
You are the GameTracker Rehydration Bug Fixer.

GOAL:
Remove the stale autosave debounce in useGameState.ts and replace it with a
hook-local timer that is cancelled on unmount and on end-game, per FINDING-007.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
spec-docs/AUDIT_LOG.md → FINDING-007
Quote: "Shared debounce persists across game boundaries; hook-local timer with
cancellation required at init, load, unmount, and end-game."

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only edit these files:
  src/src_figma/hooks/useGameState.ts
- Do NOT touch:
  src/components/GameTracker/index.tsx
  src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTrackerPage.tsx
  src/utils/trackerDb.ts
- Do NOT add new dependencies
- Do NOT rename saveCurrentGame or loadCurrentGame
- Reference FINDING-007 in a code comment at the changed lines

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- The shared debounce import is removed
- A useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null> holds the local timer
- The timer is cleared in: component init, game load, component unmount, end-game handler
- saveCurrentGame is called directly (not via debounce) when the timer fires
- No other behavior changes

VERIFICATION:
1. npm run build
2. grep -n "debounce\|clearTimeout\|timerRef" src/src_figma/hooks/useGameState.ts
3. npx vitest run src/src_figma/__tests__/gameTracker/AtBatFlow.test.tsx

FORMAT:
1. FILES CHANGED
2. CHANGES MADE (reference FINDING-007)
3. VERIFICATION OUTPUT
4. STATUS

FAILURE PROTOCOL: [standard]

Use HIGH reasoning effort. Think step-by-step.
```

### Example 2: Refactor (Modal Dumbing — Phase A)

```
You are the DefensiveSubModal Refactor Specialist.

GOAL:
Refactor DefensiveSubModal.tsx so it contains zero lineup calculation logic —
it only collects user intent and dispatches a DEFENSIVE_SUBSTITUTION action
to the GameTracker reducer, per FINDING-023.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
spec-docs/AUDIT_LOG.md → FINDING-023
spec-docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md → Phase A: Modal Dumbing

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only edit these files:
  src/src_figma/app/components/DefensiveSubModal.tsx
- Do NOT touch:
  src/components/GameTracker/index.tsx (reducer lives here — do not modify)
  src/src_figma/hooks/useGameState.ts
- The DEFENSIVE_SUBSTITUTION action type must already exist in the reducer
  before this change. If it does not exist, STOP and report.
- Do NOT add new state to the modal
- Do NOT change the modal's visual design or prop interface

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Modal receives current lineup as props (read-only)
- Modal renders player picker UI (no changes here)
- On confirm: dispatches { type: 'DEFENSIVE_SUBSTITUTION', payload: { inPlayer, outPlayer, position } }
- All lineup validity logic (e.g., duplicate position checks) is removed from modal
  and will live in the reducer's DEFENSIVE_SUBSTITUTION handler

VERIFICATION:
1. npm run build
2. grep -n "useState\|useEffect\|calculate\|filter\|sort" src/src_figma/app/components/DefensiveSubModal.tsx
   (expect: zero or near-zero hits — modal should be a pure picker)
3. grep -n "dispatch" src/src_figma/app/components/DefensiveSubModal.tsx
   (expect: exactly one dispatch call on confirm)

FORMAT: [standard]
FAILURE PROTOCOL: [standard]

Use HIGH reasoning effort. Think step-by-step.
```

### Example 3: New File Creation

```
You are the Fame Engine Architect.

GOAL:
Create src/components/GameTracker/fameEngine.ts — a pure, stateless module
containing all fame event auto-detection logic (no-hitters, cycles, clutch hits,
immaculate innings), extracted from GameTracker.tsx, per FINDING-031.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
spec-docs/AUDIT_LOG.md → FINDING-031
spec-docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md → Phase B: The Fame & Mojo Engine
src/src_figma/hooks/useFameDetection.ts → existing detection logic to port

CONSTRAINTS:
- Create only this new file:
  src/components/GameTracker/fameEngine.ts
- Do NOT modify any existing files in this prompt
  (wiring fameEngine into the reducer is a separate prompt)
- All functions must be pure (no React imports, no useState, no side effects)
- Function signatures must accept GameState and return FameEvent[] or null
- Export each detector as a named function

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- detectNoHitter(state: GameState): FameEvent | null
- detectCycle(state: GameState, batterId: string): FameEvent | null
- detectImmaculateInning(state: GameState): FameEvent | null
- detectClutchHit(state: GameState, atBat: AtBatResult): FameEvent | null
- All existing logic from useFameDetection.ts ported faithfully (no behavior changes)

VERIFICATION:
1. npm run build
2. grep -n "useState\|useEffect\|import.*React" src/components/GameTracker/fameEngine.ts
   (expect: zero hits — must be pure)
3. npx vitest run src/__tests__/fameEngine.test.ts
   (if test file doesn't exist yet, report that — test creation is a separate task)

FORMAT: [standard]
FAILURE PROTOCOL: [standard]

Use HIGH reasoning effort. Think step-by-step.
```

## PROMPT QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before sending any prompt to Codex, verify:

- [ ] Role is specific (not "a developer" — "the X Fixer" or "X Specialist")
- [ ] Goal is one sentence
- [ ] Source of truth references a real file or FINDING-NNN
- [ ] Files to touch are listed explicitly
- [ ] Files NOT to touch are listed explicitly
- [ ] Expected output is specific enough to verify against
- [ ] Verification commands are exact and runnable
- [ ] Failure protocol is included
- [ ] "High reasoning effort. Think step-by-step." is at the end

If any checkbox is empty → rewrite the prompt before sending.

## PROMPT CONTRACT: FINDING-100 — Remove Legacy Field Toggle
**Date:** 2026-02-18 | **Route:** Claude Code CLI | sonnet | standard effort

---

You are a careful dead-code removal specialist.

GOAL:
Remove the Legacy InteractiveField toggle and its entire dead branch from GameTracker.tsx,
delete the handlePlayComplete stub, and archive DragDropGameTracker.tsx.
No logic changes. No behavior changes to the Enhanced field path. Deletion only.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
FINDING-100 in spec-docs/FINDINGS/FINDINGS_056_onwards.md

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only edit these files:
    src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx
- Only move/delete this file:
    src/src_figma/app/components/DragDropGameTracker.tsx
      → move to: src/archived-components/DragDropGameTracker.tsx
- Do NOT touch:
    src/src_figma/app/components/EnhancedInteractiveField.tsx
    src/src_figma/app/components/FieldCanvas.tsx
    src/src_figma/hooks/useGameState.ts
    Any other file
- Work directly on main branch

CHANGES REQUIRED (in order):

1. In GameTracker.tsx — remove the import:
   import { InteractiveField } from "@/app/components/DragDropGameTracker";
   Delete this line entirely.

2. In GameTracker.tsx — remove the useState:
   const [useEnhancedField, setUseEnhancedField] = useState(...)
   Delete this line entirely.

3. In GameTracker.tsx — remove the toggle button from JSX:
   Find the button element that calls setUseEnhancedField(!useEnhancedField)
   and renders "ENHANCED FIELD ✓" / "LEGACY FIELD" text.
   Delete the entire button element and any wrapping div that exists solely
   to contain it.

4. In GameTracker.tsx — collapse the conditional field render:
   The JSX currently reads:
     {useEnhancedField ? ( <Enhanced branch> ) : ( <Legacy branch> )}
   Replace the entire ternary expression with ONLY the Enhanced branch content
   (the first branch), unwrapped from the ternary.
   Delete the legacy SVG field and InteractiveField JSX entirely.
   Preserve the outer div structure exactly.

5. In GameTracker.tsx — remove the dead handlePlayComplete stub:
   const handlePlayComplete = (playData: any) => {
     console.log("Play complete:", playData);
     // Update game state based on play data
     // This would update bases, outs, scores, etc.
   };
   Delete the entire function.

6. Move DragDropGameTracker.tsx to archive:
   git mv src/src_figma/app/components/DragDropGameTracker.tsx \
          src/archived-components/DragDropGameTracker.tsx

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- GameTracker.tsx has no reference to useEnhancedField, InteractiveField,
  handlePlayComplete, or DragDropGameTracker anywhere
- EnhancedInteractiveField renders unconditionally
- DragDropGameTracker.tsx exists only in archived-components/

VERIFICATION:
1. npm run build   — must pass with 0 errors
2. grep -n "useEnhancedField\|handlePlayComplete\|DragDropGameTracker\|InteractiveField" \
       src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx
   — must return NO OUTPUT
3. ls src/archived-components/DragDropGameTracker.tsx   — must exist

FORMAT:
1. Files changed (list exact paths)
2. Changes made (describe each, reference FINDING-100)
3. Verification result (paste exact output of all 3 commands)
4. "FINDING-100 complete" OR "BLOCKED: [exact reason]"

FAILURE PROTOCOL:
- If anything is ambiguous → quote the exact section and stop
- If a change would require touching a file not listed → STOP and report
- If build fails → git checkout -- . to revert, then report the error
- Never summarize or batch changes
- Never assume intent — ask

Use high reasoning effort. Think step-by-step. This is deletion only — do not add anything.

## PROMPT CONTRACT: FINDING-101 — Fix Fan Morale Method Name + Season Wiring
**Date:** 2026-02-18 | **Route:** Codex | 5.1 mini | medium effort

---

You are a careful bug-fix specialist.

GOAL:
Fix two bugs in how GameTracker.tsx calls the fan morale hook at end-game:
Bug A — wrong method name (processGameResult → recordGameResult)
Bug B — hardcoded season/game numbers ({ season: 1, game: 1 } → real values)

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
FINDING-101 in spec-docs/FINDINGS/FINDINGS_056_onwards.md

CONSTRAINTS:
- Only edit this file:
    src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx
- Do NOT touch:
    src/hooks/useFanMorale.ts
    src/engines/fanMoraleEngine.ts
    Any other file
- Work directly on main branch

CHANGES REQUIRED:

1. Find these two call sites (lines ~2138 and ~2152):
     homeFanMorale.processGameResult(homeResult, { season: 1, game: 1 }, ...)
     awayFanMorale.processGameResult(awayResult, { season: 1, game: 1 }, ...)

   Rename processGameResult → recordGameResult on both call sites.

   Note: recordGameResult takes only ONE argument: (result: GameResult)
   The current calls pass 3 arguments. The hook signature is:
     recordGameResult: (result: GameResult) => void
   Drop the second argument ({ season: 1, game: 1 }) and third argument
   (the rival team name string) — they are not part of the hook interface.

2. The GameResult object (homeResult / awayResult) already has a gameId field.
   No changes needed to the result objects themselves.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Both call sites use recordGameResult with a single argument
- No other changes to GameTracker.tsx

VERIFICATION:
1. npm run build — must pass with 0 new errors
2. grep -n "processGameResult" src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx
   — must return NO OUTPUT
3. grep -n "recordGameResult" src/src_figma/app/pages/GameTracker.tsx
   — must show exactly 2 lines

FORMAT:
1. Files changed (list exact paths)
2. Changes made (describe each, reference FINDING-101)
3. Verification result (paste exact output of all 3 commands)
4. "FINDING-101 complete" OR "BLOCKED: [exact reason]"

FAILURE PROTOCOL:
- If the hook signature differs from what is described above → quote what you see and STOP
- If build fails → git checkout -- . to revert, then report the error
- Never touch useFanMorale.ts or fanMoraleEngine.ts

Use high reasoning effort. Two-line fix. Do not change anything else.
