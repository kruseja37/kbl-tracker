# Exhaustive Spec Auditor — Assets

No binary assets required. All audit artifacts are generated as markdown files
in spec-docs/ during execution.

Generated files:
- spec-docs/EXHAUSTIVE_AUDIT_PROGRESS.md (from references/PROGRESS_TEMPLATE.md)
- spec-docs/SPEC_CONTRADICTIONS.md (created during Phase 1)
- spec-docs/SPEC_INDEX.md (created during Phase 2)
- Consolidated spec files in category folders (Phase 2)
