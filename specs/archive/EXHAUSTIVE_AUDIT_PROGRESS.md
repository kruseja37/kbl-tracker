### Batch 3: GameTracker Extended
| Spec | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| CLUTCH_ATTRIBUTION_SPEC.md | DONE | 41 MATCH, 4 MISMATCH (1 MAJ: inside_park_hr CQ applied wrongly, 3 MIN: popup pitcher base 0.4 vs 0.5, ground_out pitcher base 0.4 vs 0.5, WP flat -0.7 vs split -0.6/-0.8), 7 GAP (2 MAJ: shift tracking missing + manager auto-detection missing, 5 MIN: D3K attribution, 3-pickoff rule, baserunning clutch events, zone-based CQ, ManagerDecision record), 3 UNDOC (walkoff ×1.5 bonus, voting component already in spec, TP→GIDP mapping) |
| LEVERAGE_INDEX_SPEC.md | DONE | 33 MATCH, 1 MISMATCH MIN (3-run dampener comment says opposite of behavior — formula matches spec), 1 GAP MIN (LI not persisted per PA), 6 UNDOC (extra innings ramp-up, decodeBaseState, estimateWinProbability, estimateGmLI, LIAccumulator system, display helpers). Note: spec §10.5-10.7 (revenge arc/romantic/family modifiers) ALL implemented with matching constants and stacking rules. Highly aligned spec. |
| FIELDING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 39 MATCH, 4 MISMATCH (3 MAJ: missing foul directions FL/FR in all matrices, pop fly missing depth dimension, DP center missing 1-6-3 option; 1 MIN: LD LC secondary only CF not LF/CF), 11 GAP (3 MAJ: foul ball zones missing, shift handling missing, FieldingPlay schema incomplete; 8 MIN: PlayerFieldingStats aggregation incomplete, IFR auto-detect not wired, GRD tracking partial, bad hop UI missing, robbery prompt missing, contextual UI missing, D3K handler selector missing, adaptive learning MATCH but localStorage-based), 4 UNDOC (inferDirectionFromX thresholds, inferExitTypeFromLocation y-depth, inferPlayDifficulty thresholds, confidence edge adjustments). Large spec (1166 lines, 21 sections) vs focused code (387-line inference engine + 489-line adaptive learning). Core inference matrices MATCH for fair territory but many spec features exist only as type stubs in game.ts. |
| GAMETRACKER_DRAGDROP_SPEC.md | DONE | 29 MATCH (coordinate system exists, foul territory auto-detect, drag patterns 1-7 implemented via EnhancedInteractiveField, contextual buttons with auto-dismiss, undo system component exists, runner drag-drop implemented, fielder drag-drop + tap sequence, lineup card substitutions, bullpen panel, HR button + drag-to-stands), 3 MISMATCH (2 MAJ: HR classification thresholds differ due to coord system change, fielder positions differ but both valid; 1 MIN: Fame values outdated in spec vs SPECIAL_EVENTS_SPEC v3.3), 5 GAP (all MINOR: error entry via long-press not gesture-triggered, HR distance input missing, double-switch combined UX not implemented, undo wiring unclear, BaserunnerDragDrop is stub), 4 UNDOC (field-feet coord system, PlayContext inference details, foul auto-classification working, KP/NUT mutual exclusivity). Design spec — heavily implemented, most patterns working. |
| FIELD_ZONE_INPUT_SPEC.md | DONE | 24 MATCH (all 25 FIELD_ZONES definitions, ZONE_TO_RAW_DIRECTION all 25 entries, LEFT_HAND_MAP, RIGHT_HAND_MAP, getDirectionFromZone logic, ZONE_TO_DEPTH all 25 entries, getDepthFromZone, getZoneData return shape, AREA_COLORS all 8 entries, getFielderSuggestions all 25 entries, touch interaction flow, findZoneAtPoint + nearest fallback, FieldZoneInput component structure, zone info panel, fielder override grid, confirm button, disabled state, SVG rendering, position markers, point-in-polygon detection), 6 MISMATCH (2 MAJ: CQ integration missing entirely + spray chart generation missing entirely; 4 MIN: polygon coords refined, zone centers adjusted, 2 foul quick taps removed, onFielderOverride prop simplified), 4 GAP (3 MAJ: zone-to-CQ bridge functions, spray chart generation layer, stadium spray integration; 1 MIN: recordBattedBall partial integration), 5 UNDOC (pointInPolygon algorithm, parseSVGPath, landscape layout orientation, animated selection indicator, foul depth remapping in FieldingModal). Strongest implementation among Batch 3 specs — zone system core is perfectly implemented. Major gaps are in CQ and spray chart integration layers. |

### Batch 4: Player Systems
| Spec | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| MOJO_FITNESS_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 40 MATCH (all 5 Mojo levels/multipliers, all 21 triggers, all 5 amplification values, carryover 30%, Rattled stickiness 0.7×, all 6 Fitness states/multipliers, all decay configs 5 position categories, all recovery configs + traits + rest bonuses, Juiced 5-day/20-game reqs, all injury risk modifiers, all Fame modifiers both Mojo+Fitness, all WAR multipliers both Mojo+Fitness, Clutch multipliers, applyCombinedModifiers Speed/Junk differentiation, MojoEntry/Snapshot/SplitStats types, suggestMojoChange, inferMojoTriggers, badge emojis, season start Juiced, recovery projection, stigma narratives, display helpers), 1 MISMATCH MAJ (PlayerMojoSplits only has battingByMojo — missing 3/4 split categories), 1 MISMATCH MIN (fitness state value→state ranges wider than implied by spec anchor values), 4 GAP (1 MAJ: recordPAWithContext/accumulation functions missing; 3 MIN: Mojo not stamped per-PA, no between-game team editor UI, combined player card partial), 4 UNDOC (customDelta override, processMojoTriggers batch, MojoGameStats aggregation, reliever rest-day 1.5× recovery). EXCELLENT implementation — core engine 98% complete. Only split accumulation pipeline missing. |
| FAME_SYSTEM_TRACKING.md | DONE | TRACKING DOC (not traditional spec). Verified all 13 "COMPLETE" claims — all accurate. Verified 4 bugs: BUG-001 confirmed not-a-bug, BUG-002/003/004 all verified FIXED in code. FOUND 3 MAJOR MISMATCHES: (1) FameEventType count is 154 not 67, (2) COMPLETE_GAME/SHUTOUT/MADDUX listed as "NOT STARTED" but FULLY IMPLEMENTED in useFameDetection.ts, (3) Fame persistence listed as "Lost on page refresh" but IS saved to IndexedDB. INC-002 (Strike out side partial) VERIFIED ACCURATE. INC-003 (no natural cycle tracking) VERIFIED ACCURATE. INC-004 (winner=null) needs verification in Figma GT. ~25 detection functions remain NOT STARTED (defensive events, some boner events, position player pitching) — tracking doc claims ACCURATE for these. fameEngine.ts (882 lines) is comprehensive with LI weighting, playoff multipliers, career/season milestones with dynamic scaling, Fame tiers. 18 MATCH, 3 MISMATCH (2 MAJ outdated status + count, 1 MIN persistence claim), 0 GAP (it's a tracker not a spec), 0 UNDOC. |
| SALARY_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 27 MATCH (all position player weights 3:3:2:1:1, pitcher weights 1:1:1, all 16 position multipliers, 6 trait tier arrays, 6 trait salary impact values, all 7 personality modifiers, base formula (w/100)^2.5×50, MIN_SALARY=0.5, performance modifier 1+(delta×0.10) capped [0.5,1.5], Fame modifier 1+(fame×0.03) capped [0.7,1.3], age factors all tiers, pitcher batting bonuses CON≥70/55/40, True Value percentile-based, swap requirements winner 90-110% loser 70-100%, draft budget formula). 0 MISMATCH, 0 GAP, 6 UNDOC (SalaryBreakdown type, position merge groups, backward compat exports, display helpers, ROI tier calc, DHContext system). CLEANEST AUDIT — 100% spec-code alignment on all constants, formulas, and logic. |
| GRADE_ALGORITHM_SPEC.md | DONE | 5 MATCH (position player 3:3:2:1:1 weights in salary calc + test, pitcher 1:1:1 weights, 12-grade scale S-D, potentialCeiling concept, DraftProspect fields). 4 MISMATCH MAJ (MAJ-B4-004: test helper thresholds S≥90 vs spec S≥80 — every boundary differs by 8-15pts; MAJ-B4-005: no grade engine in prod code; MAJ-B4-006: two-way 1.25× premium missing; MAJ-B4-007: prospect generation uses random grade not weighted calculation). 7 GAP MAJ + 1 GAP MIN (no engine file, two-way player, position stat bias, round probabilities, ceiling probabilities, pitcher prospect gen, arsenal gen, trait pool). 2 UNDOC (grade display helpers duplicated 5+ files, mock prospect personality field). LARGELY UNIMPLEMENTED — spec provides complete algorithm code but no production engine was created. Only test helper + hardcoded mocks exist. |
| FAN_FAVORITE_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 5 MATCH (valueDelta in calculateTrueValue, position-relative percentile, TrueValue return interface, fanMorale infrastructure, FAN_FAVORITE as Fame tier). 0 MISMATCH. 14 GAP ALL MAJOR (detectFanFavorite, detectAlbatross, qualification threshold, in-season happiness effects, transaction happiness effects, trade value modifier, contract negotiation modifier, narrative headlines, 4 Fame event types missing from enum, end-of-season processing, UI display with delta badges, projected vs locked status, cross-season carryover, Albatross reason generation). 1 UNDOC (FAN_FAVORITE Fame tier name collision with Fan Favorite designation system). ENTIRELY UNIMPLEMENTED SYSTEM. Foundation exists (calculateTrueValue returns valueDelta, fanMoraleEngine exists) but the Fan Favorite/Albatross detection layer, effects, UI, and integration are all missing. |

### Batch 5: Franchise & Offseason
| Spec | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| FRANCHISE_MODE_SPEC.md | DONE | PLANNING SPEC (status: PLANNING). 6 MATCH (franchise hierarchy concept exists via FranchiseHome page, franchiseId routing /franchise/:id, FranchiseFirst types in franchiseStorage.ts, FranchiseLeader types, FRANCHISE_FIRST_FAME_VALUES 10 entries, isLeaderTrackingActive 10% threshold). 0 MISMATCH. 8 GAP ALL MAJOR (FranchiseManager API, separate DB per franchise, franchise switching, legacy migration, export/import, franchise selector UI, in-game indicator, storage monitoring). 1 UNDOC (FranchiseHome.tsx 228K page goes far beyond this spec). franchiseStorage.ts is ENTIRELY STUBS (all functions return null, created 2026-02-03 as build fix). This spec is explicitly deferred ("PLANNING - Build out deferred until other features complete"). |
| OFFSEASON_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 33 MATCH, 16 MISMATCH (1 CRIT: FA dice order inverted, 10 MAJ: phase count 10vs11, retirement formula age-based vs rank-based, draft grade capped B vs A-, draft hardcoded vs generated, MVP/CY voting weights missing, salary floor/ceiling by grade missing, True Value calc missing, EOS contract adj missing, two conflicting phase systems, FA COMPETITIVE hardcoded rival; 5 MIN: RELAXED 50/50 vs equal, TOUGH wins vs OPS, TIMID best-record vs champion, FA 8-team limit, draft class not randomized). 24 GAP (15 MAJ: Farm Reconciliation engine, Chemistry Rebalancing engine, Morale system events, personality distribution weights, personality shifts, trait/reward assignments, League Leader rewards, Postseason MVP, championship bonus, Mojo reset, Scorned Player effects, Expansion Draft selection, FA Exchange Rule, Draft order WAR-based, AI Trade Proposals, New Season Prep engine; 9 MIN: Booger Glove penalty, trait replacement, streamlined mode, draft rules, HOF data model, OffseasonState model, FAMove model, multiplayer). 13 UNDOC (Spring Training naming, ManagerBonus types, retirement reasons, FreeAgentSigning contract model, DraftPick potential, beat reporter, waiver wire, 3-way trades, potentialCeiling, relationship trade warnings, AgingEngine, useOffseasonPhase.ts, two parallel offseason systems). MASSIVE SPEC (2280 lines) — UI shells exist for all 11 phases but most backend engines are missing. CRITICAL: FA dice assignment is inverted (best player gets 2.78% leave chance, spec says 16.67%). |
| TRADE_SYSTEM_SPEC.md | DONE | 18 MATCH (Trade storage types, status values, IndexedDB persistence, offseason phase, 2-way + 3-way trade UI, AI response types, counter-offer UI, salary impact, trade history, AI proposals inbox, beat reporter warnings, fan morale trade events +8/-10/-8, scrutiny 14 games, relationship warnings, TradeWarning interface, farm prospect indicator, proposedBy). 4 MISMATCH (2 MAJ: phase ordering 8vs10, trade matching ratio-based vs 10% threshold; 2 MIN: phase count 10vs11, AI decision random vs multi-factor). 23 GAP (12 CRIT: FranchiseConfig control modes, calculatePackageValue, isTradeValid 10% rule, DraftSwap + estimateSwapValue, TradedPlayer interface, TradedProspect interface, calculateTradeMoraleImpact, assessChemistryLoss, calculateFanTradeReaction, updateExpectedWins, evaluateTradeAsCPU, generateCounterOffer; 9 MAJ: Trade Veto system, trade windows + deadline, deadline drama UI, True Value hiding, trade impact preview, morale display 0-99, morale factors detail, validateThreeTeamTrade, salary cap implications; 2 MIN: TradePackage interface, team page morale column). 7 UNDOC (waiver wire UI, beat reporter triggers, isDraftee flag, older TradeHub page, TradeSalaryMatcher, FranchiseHome inline trade, trade persistence hook).
